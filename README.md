# QCHFM – Quantum-Coherent Hybrid Flow Modeling

QCHFM (Quantum-Coherent Hybrid Flow Modeling) is a layered simulation framework combining physics-based fluid dynamics, practical engineering solvers, and quantum-inspired stochastic modeling. It is designed to simulate complex environments where uncertainty, chaos, and turbulence are present.

## 📐 Core Structure

QCHFM operates through three integrated layers:

- **Theoretic Core** – Classical fluid dynamics using Navier-Stokes equations
- **Practice Layer** – Numerical methods like Finite Volume Method (FVM), turbulence modeling (LES, k-ε), adaptive meshing
- **Quantum Overlay** – Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) modeling uncertainty, with confidence index mapping

## 🧪 Use Cases

- **🪐 Mars Atmospheric Simulation** – Wind modeling inside Valles Marineris or Gale Crater
- **🩸 Biomedical Microfluidics** – Simulating blood flow in capillaries with chaotic micro-dynamics
- **⚛️ Fusion Plasma Flow** – Edge instabilities and stochastic turbulence in toroidal reactors
- **✈️ Civilian Aviation** – Aircraft routing and turbulence prediction with confidence-aware guidance

QCHFM helps simulations do more than predict — it helps them know where to trust their own answers.
